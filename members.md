### Change My E-mail

When sending out e-mails, the HQ system always uses your VATSIM registered e-mail. This is the e-mail you added when you first signed up for VATSIM. You can change your VATSIM registered e-mail any time by visiting this link: [http://cert.vatsim.net/vatsimnet/newmail.php](http://cert.vatsim.net/vatsimnet/newmail.php)

#### Event ATC/Flight Booking

You can click on an event in the calendar to view the event page for that event. On the event page, there may also be ATC and flight bookings. These are added by the staff who created the event. The ATC booking page is used to coordinate ATC for an event. The flight booking page allows **any** member of VATSIM to log into HQ and book a flight.

#### Create an Observation Request

You can create an observation request if you have a rating of S1 or higher. You start by going to the Observation Request page. This page shows you all the observation requests that you have submitted. The top table shows requests that are still pending review and the bottom table shows completed requests. 

To create a new Observation Request, click the green "Add Observation Request" button on the top right of the page.

<br/>

On the Observation Request form page, you should start by reading the "policy". This is very important otherwise, your request may be rejected. In addition, you should also review your vACC training policies to see if they have added anything more about Observation Requests. Fill out the rest of the form fields and submit.
