### Choose a vACC

If your division is part of the HQ system and you are a resident member in the division, you will be asked to choose a Home vACC when first logging into the system. A vACC manages an area of airspace within the division. Your Home vACC is where you will do your training and spend most of your time controlling in.

There may be some vACCs in the list that you will not be able to choose if they are "open". An "open" vACC is one that has no staff members and will be difficult for you to find help or training in that vACC. You will be able to choose another vACC that has staff who will guide you in the training processes and understand the VATSIM network. In the future, once you have a better understanding of the network, you can apply to be a staff in the "open" vACC.

### Change My vACC

If you want to change your vACC in the same division you are in, you will need to open a ticket with your division staff. To find our which division you belong in, click the little down arrow next to your name on the left side menu. Then click "My Profile".

<br/>Once you know your division, on the left side menu click the red "Need Help?" button. Create a ticket and assign it to your division to request a vACC change. Your division staff will reply to the ticket and let you know how to proceed with the transfer.

**Note:** Your request may be rejected if it is found that you are requesting changes too many times.<br/>


### Change My E-mail

When sending out e-mails, the HQ system always uses your VATSIM registered e-mail. This is the e-mail you added when you first signed up for VATSIM. You can change your VATSIM registered e-mail any time by visiting this link: [http://cert.vatsim.net/vatsimnet/newmail.php](http://cert.vatsim.net/vatsimnet/newmail.php)


### Events

All upcoming events that are sponsored by the regions, divisions, or vACCs in the HQ system will be display on a calendar on the dashboard (homepage). You can view this calendar any time by clicking the "Dashboard" link on the left side menu.

You can click on an event in the calendar to view the event page for that event. On the event page, there may also be ATC and flight bookings. These are added by the staff who created the event. The ATC booking page is used to coordinate ATC for an event. The flight booking page allows **any** member of VATSIM to log into HQ and book a flight.
