# Members

### Menu

On the left side menu, there is a dropdown menu for **Members** which shows you all the functions that are available to you. Some of the functions are explained below.

### Choose a vACC

If your division is part of the HQ system and you are a resident member in the division, you will be asked to choose a Home vACC when first logging into the system. A vACC manages an area of airspace within the division. Your Home vACC is where you will do your training and spend most of your time controlling in.

There may be some vACCs in the list that you will not be able to choose if they are "open". An "open" vACC is one that has no staff members and will be difficult for you to find help or training in that vACC. You will be able to choose another vACC that has staff who will guide you in the training processes and understand the VATSIM network. In the future, once you have a better understanding of the network, you can apply to be a staff in the "open" vACC.

### Change My vACC

If you want to change your vACC in the same division you are in, you will need to open a ticket with your division staff. To find our which division you belong in, click the little down arrow next to your name on the left side menu. Then click "My Profile".

<br/>On your profile page, you will find your "Division" name.

<br/>Once you know your division, on the left side menu click the red "Need Help?" button. Create a ticket and assign it to your division to request a vACC change. Your division staff will reply to the ticket and let you know how to proceed with the transfer.

**Note:** Your request may be rejected if it is found that you are requesting changes too many times.<br/>


### Change My E-mail

When sending out e-mails, the HQ system always uses your VATSIM registered e-mail. This is the e-mail you added when you first signed up for VATSIM. You can change your VATSIM registered e-mail any time by visiting this link: [http://cert.vatsim.net/vatsimnet/newmail.php](http://cert.vatsim.net/vatsimnet/newmail.php)


### Events

All upcoming events that are sponsored by the regions, divisions, or vACCs in the HQ system will be display on a calendar on the dashboard (homepage). You can view this calendar any time by clicking the "Dashboard" link on the left side menu.

#### Event ATC/Flight Booking

You can click on an event in the calendar to view the event page for that event. On the event page, there may also be ATC and flight bookings. These are added by the staff who created the event. The ATC booking page is used to coordinate ATC for an event. The flight booking page allows **any** member of VATSIM to log into HQ and book a flight.

### Observation Requests

The "Observation Request" (OR) is an optional training method that is used by some vACCs. This allows an ATC student to post videos of themselves controlling online and the vACC training staff will review the video. The vACC training staff will leave feedback for the video to help the student understand how they are doing at their current rating before moving to the next rating.

There are two primary ways of recording and uploading your video: YouTube or Twitch. It is highly recommended to use YouTube, because **Twitch only keeps your videos for 14 days** and then they are deleted!

There are 2 video tutorials to help you understand how to set up the recording software and link it to YouTube/Twitch. Please review the following videos...

YouTube method: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaDJsZp2szs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaDJsZp2szs)
<br/>Twitch method: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrD3vqe_DXQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrD3vqe_DXQ)

**Please review your vACC training policies before using this feature to be sure how they use it. Some vACCs may not use this feature, so it's best to make sure or ask the vACC staff. In order to submit an observation request for a vACC, the vACC staff must have this feature enabled.**

#### Create an Observation Request

You can create an observation request if you have a rating of S1 or higher. You start by going to the Observation Request page. This page shows you all the observation requests that you have submitted. The top table shows requests that are still pending review and the bottom table shows completed requests. 

To create a new Observation Request, click the green "Add Observation Request" button on the top right of the page.

<br/>

On the Observation Request form page, you should start by reading the "policy". This is very important otherwise, your request may be rejected. In addition, you should also review your vACC training policies to see if they have added anything more about Observation Requests. Fill out the rest of the form fields and submit.
