# Instructors/Mentors

### Menu

On the left side menu, there is a dropdown menu for **Instructors/Mentors **which shows you all the functions that are available to you. Some of the functions are explained below.

### Assigning Exams

If you are an instructor or mentor and need to assign an exam, first go to the student's profile by searching their VATSIM ID at the top search bar on the HQ. You can also go to the your vACC homepage and search under **ATC Roster**. In the student's profile page scroll down to the section called **Exams,** and use the dropdown to select the desired exam. Once the student has finished taking an exam all instructors/mentors in the vACC will be notified via email. You will also be able to come to the student's profile page to view their exam\(s\).

**Instructors and mentors can only assign exams for members who are in their vACC.**

### Exam Report System

Instructors can submit report for rating upgrades for members. You can do so by going to the **Exam Report System **section, then **New Exam Report. **Once the report has been sent it will be reviewed by division staff before the student is upgraded. Once a report has been approved or rejected the instructor will be notified via e-mail. The student will receive an e-mail from VATSIM about the rating change. In some regions/divisions, the upgrade request will be processed automatically and you will receive a notification once that is done.

**Note: **Only instructors will be able to submit exam reports. The director/deputy director can also submit exam reports. See above in the vACC Staff section.

### Mentoring

#### Add my Availability

Instructors and mentors can post available times to mentor a student. Students will then be able to pick your time if they are available. Once the student has picked up your availability, instructor/mentor will be notified on email and in the HQ. When adding your availability you can chose between two restrictions for students. **Rating Restrictions **and **Residents/Visitors Restriction. **If you would like to restrict your session to only a certain rating, then you may select your desired rating under **Rating Restrictions**. Once added, only students with the specific rating will be able to choose your mentoring session.

Example: If you would like to do a session for **Observers \(OBS\)**, choose **Observers \(OBS\) **under **Rating Restrictions.**

You can also restrict your session to only resident or visitor controllers. You can do so by choosing either **Any, Visitors only **or **Residents only **when adding your available times.

#### Pick a Mentoring Session

To pick up a student request go to the **Mentoring Requests **section. This page will list all the available students requests. By accepting a student request the instructor/mentor accept \(..\). Once a student request has been accepted the student will be notified via email and on the HQ. Instructor/mentors will be copied into the email, this way the student and instructor/mentor can communicate with each other.
