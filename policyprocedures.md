### Home
The policy/procedure center allows staff members to create policies or procedure documents for their vACC, division, or region. The "Home" page shows all the policies in your relevant area that are approved, waiting to be approved, or in draft status. Any staff member can create a policy/procedure document.

**If you are a vACC staff**, then you will only be able to view policies/procedures created in your vACC.

**If you are a division staff**, then you will be able to view policies/procedures created by your division staff or any of the vACCs under your division.

**If you are a regional staff**, then you will be able to view the same as division staff but for all divisions under your region.
