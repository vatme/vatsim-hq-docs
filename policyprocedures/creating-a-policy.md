### Create Category
To start a policy, a category must be created if there is not one available. Example: if you are creating a policy regarding ATC Progression, then you can create a category "ATC Training".

On the bottom table, you can see which categories have been created and delete one if it is no longer used. Only categories that are not assigned to any policies can be deleted.

### Create Policy
Once the category is created, you can create the policy. Before creating the policy, you should work with your staff members on the document and finalize it as best as possible. You can use tools such as Google Docs to work collaboratively. In the HQ system, the document can be worked on by one person only. If multiple staff are creating or updating the policy document, it will be overwritten by the last member.

Once the policy is created, you will have additional tabs available: **Comments** and **Approval**.

When editing a policy, it will require to enter "Note any changes". The text will be submitted as a comment on the comments tab. Once an edit is submitted, a notification is sent to your staff team notifying them that this policy was updated by you.

The red **RESET** button will reset the text editor to blank. Only use this to start the policy again from blank!

If a policy is "Release for Approval" the approvers listed on the table will receive an email asking them to view this policy and approve it. Once it is released for approval, you will not be able to edit the policy until it has been approved or one of the approvers changes the status to DRAFT.
